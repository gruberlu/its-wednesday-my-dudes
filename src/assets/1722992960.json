{"text": "Imagine a unique and delightful spectacle. A frog, but not just any ordinary frog. This amphibian is decked out with swimming goggles, ready to plunge into a challenging swimming session. It's seated comfortably in a black swivel chair behind a desk, paperwork spread out and a cup of warm coffee nearby. Above its head on a shelf are some certificates possibly for swimming accolades. The room is dimly lit, with the soft gleam from a desk lamp casting elongated shadows. Its eyes, protected by the goggles, are focused diligently on the task at hand, completely submerged in this typical human office-life situation."}
