{"text": "Imagine a whimsical scene related with everyday human life. At the heart of it is a vibrant green frog, curiously dressed with a pair of swimming goggles perched on its head. It's amusing how it emulates human-like behaviors, constantly bringing a smile to faces around. The surrounding should be very mundane, such as a park, grocery store, or ordinary street, encouraging the audience to consider how this frog would navigate such a human world."}
