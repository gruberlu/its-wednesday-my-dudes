{"text": "Imagine an amusing scenario where a frog is anthropomorphized. This green, small-sized amphibian is wearing a pair of swimming goggles for protection. Although living in the wild, it finds itself in a situation that is usually known to humans. It's attempting to figure out a subway map, standing just like a human, on its hind legs, by a subway station pole. The other subway passengers, rendered in a non-specific descent and diverse genders, are looking at the frog with curiosity and amusement, unsure of how to react."}
