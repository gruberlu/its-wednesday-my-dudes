{"text": "A very detailed illustration of a frog, complete with its green skin, bulging eyes, and long muscular legs. This isn't any ordinary frog though, it's wearing a pair of swimming goggles resting atop its head, their rubber straps seamlessly blending with the frog's complexion. It's caught in a humorously human-like situation - sitting in a cozy armchair, engrossed in a newspaper that it seems to be browsing with its webbed fingers. The setting should be a lightly decorated living room with soft lighting, giving off a charmingly whimsical vibe as this frog immerses itself in human activities."}
