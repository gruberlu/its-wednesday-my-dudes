{"text": "Imagine a vibrant green frog with a pair of dazzling swimming goggles perched on its head. The frog finds itself in a curious predicament that is typically human. It is sitting at a desk, surrounded by stacks of paper and a computer, resembling an office worker in the middle of a busy work day. A half-eaten sandwich and a cup of tepid coffee sit nearby, suggesting a lunch break interrupted by an urgent email. Despite its out-of-place surroundings, the frog seems utterly at ease, handling the mouse with one webbed foot and typing diligently with the other."}
