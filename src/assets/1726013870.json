{"text": "Imagine a vivid scene where a vibrant green frog has successfully managed to put on a pair of bubble-eyed swimming goggles. See the way the goggles are slightly too big for its tiny head, but the frog seems to wear them with pride and even a bit of moxie. Place this amphibian in a humorous and ordinary human-like situation, such as patiently waiting in line to order coffee at a hip local caf√©. The frog stands on the countertop, peering over at the menu board with a discerning look. The other customers, diverse in terms of both gender and ethnicity, look on with a mixture of amusement and surprise."}
