{"text": "Imagine a vivid scene where a frog with olive green skin is donned in a pair of clear swimming goggles. The frog finds itself in a uniquely human-like situation. It's seated at a mahogany desk, with a pile of paperwork and a blue ballpoint pen. There's a half-empty coffee cup nearby. It appears to be working diligently, perhaps on important frog business. The room is filled with soft, ambient light coming from a desk lamp. The walls feature muted shades of cream. The soft croaking of the frog mingles harmoniously with the ticking of an old-style wall clock."}
