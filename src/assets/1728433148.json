{"text": "Create a detailed image of a humorous scene. In the center, there should be a vibrant green frog. This frog is donned in over-sized, clear swimming goggles that are slightly askew on its face. It is engaged in an everyday human activity: reading a newspaper. The paper should be spread out in front of it, and despite its unusual attire, the frog appears completely engrossed in the headlines. The frog forms a sharp contrast to the mundane domestic background, perhaps a wooden table and a steaming mug of coffee."}
